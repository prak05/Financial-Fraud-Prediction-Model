# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Leveraging Machine Learning for Real-time Transaction Anomaly Detection

### Project Overview
The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project is a comprehensive machine learning initiative focused on identifying fraudulent transactions within credit card datasets. Given the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data, this project emphasizes robust data preprocessing, advanced classification techniques, and specialized evaluation metrics to build an effective and reliable fraud detection system. The goal is to minimize financial losses for institutions and protect consumers from fraudulent activities.

### Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Handles raw transaction data, including feature scaling using `StandardScaler` and addressing class imbalance.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducts in-depth analysis and visualization using `seaborn` and `plotly.express` to understand transaction patterns, feature distributions, and the characteristics of fraudulent versus legitimate transactions.
* **Class Imbalance Handling:** Implements techniques like `RandomOverSampler` from `imblearn` to mitigate the challenges posed by highly imbalanced datasets, ensuring models do not simply predict the majority class.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Develops and evaluates various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting – *customize based on what you actually used*) for fraud detection.
* **Model Evaluation & Optimization:** Utilizes appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve, alongside cross-validation (`cross_val_score` from `sklearn`) to thoroughly assess model performance, especially concerning false positives and false negatives.
* **Reproducible Workflow:** Presented in a clear Jupyter Notebook format, enabling step-by-step understanding and execution of the data science pipeline.

### Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Data Science Libraries:**
    * Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
    * NumPy (for numerical operations)
    * Matplotlib (for basic plotting)
    * Seaborn (for advanced statistical data visualization)
    * Plotly Express (for interactive visualizations)
    * Scikit-learn (for machine learning models, preprocessing, and metrics)
    * Imblearn (Scikit-learn-contrib) (for handling imbalanced datasets)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (specifically designed for Google Colab, but adaptable locally)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### Getting Started

To explore and run this project locally or in Google Colab, you will need Python and the necessary libraries.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `pip` (Python package installer).
* Access to Google Colab (optional, but recommended as the notebook is Colab-native).

#### Installation (Local Environment)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure you create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all libraries used in your notebook, especially `imbalanced-learn`).

#### Running the Project

1.  **Using Google Colab (Recommended):**
    * Upload `credit_card_fraud.ipynb` to your Google Drive.
    * Open it with Google Colab.
    * Run all cells sequentially. You may need to upload the dataset file (`card_transdata.csv.zip` as indicated in the notebook) directly into the Colab environment when prompted.

2.  **Using Jupyter Notebook (Local):**
    * Ensure all dependencies are installed.
    * Place your dataset file (e.g., `card_transdata.csv`) in a suitable location relative to the notebook, or modify the data loading path in the notebook.
    * Launch Jupyter Notebook from your project directory:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    * Click on `credit_card_fraud.ipynb` to open and run the notebook.
